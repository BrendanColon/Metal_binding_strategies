# Metal_binding_strategies

Metals serve as cofactors to conduct some of the most fundemental chemistries of life. Heavy metals often poise a threat to living systems as they imitate normal metal cofactors in biological systems but are not functional. This can cause proteins to become inactive and have serious cellular consequences. This study will examine how heavy metals interact with the structure of known proteins.
